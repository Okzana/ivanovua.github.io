## Summary
I'm Linux, Unix system engineer
In my work experience below you'll find over 6 year of Unix and Linux system administration including network administration and DevOps. Part of being a system administrator required many things of me such as: team work, technical writing, project planning and problem solving. Also, a big part of system administration is learning new technologies on a regular basis. When working on a new project, I like to speak with the client, so that I can have a clear understanding of his/her needs and vision of the project.
